# Flipkart Clone
This is a Flipkart clone project, which is an e-commerce website that allows users to purchase a variety of products online. This project was created as a part of my learning process to practice my skills in web development using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.

# Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface of the website.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend of the website.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store product data and user information.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to create the backend API.

JWT: A JSON Web Token used for user authentication.

# Other technologies used include:
Axios: A Promise-based HTTP client used to make API calls from the frontend to the backend.

Material-UI: A frontend framework used for responsive design and styling.

React Router: A routing library used to manage navigation between pages.

# Features
The Flipkart clone includes the following features:

Product Listing: Users can browse through a list of products and view their details.

Cart: Users can add products to their cart, view their cart, and checkout.

User Authentication: Users can create an account, login, and logout.

Search: Users can search for products by name or category.

# How to Run the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Navigate to the root directory of the project and run npm install to install the required dependencies.

3.Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

makefile

Copy code

MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>

JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>

Replace <your_mongodb_uri> with your MongoDB connection string and <your_jwt_secret> with a secret key for JSON Web Tokens.

Run npm start to start the backend API.

Navigate to the client directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies for the frontend.

Run npm start to start the frontend.

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

# Conclusion
This Flipkart clone project was a great way for me to practice my skills in web development and learn more about the MERN stack. With its extensive features and user-friendly interface, this project demonstrates the power and versatility of using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB for web development.
